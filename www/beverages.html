<p style="font-size: 20px">Step 1:Boil water.
Different types of tea require different water temperature to brew. Check the tea packaging to see the recommended water temperature. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px">
Warm up teapot.
This step is a detail that takes your tea to the next level and almost no one does it. But they should. Take some of the boiled water and fill half the teapot and give it a few swirls then throw out the water. We’re warming the teapot so that when the hot water for tea goes in, the water temperature won’t drop too much.

<p style="font-size: 20px">
 Put tea into teapot and add hot water.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px">
Cover teapot and steep tea.
Set the timer on your phone to steep it to the correct amount of time. The steep time is different for each kind of tea so check the tea package to see what is recommended. Usually it’s no more than 5 minutes.

Strain tea solids and pour hot tea into tea cups.
